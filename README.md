# A Blueprint Description of Optimization Models for Digital Shadows of Production Scheduling in Injection Molding

We provide a standardized description of production scheduling models according to the Graham notation [1]. The standardized description is based on IEC 61360-1 [2]. Our work supports developers in implementing the vision of Industry 4.0 by providing a standardized vocabulary so assets can communicate with the models using a common language. This, for example, is a basis for Digital Shadows (DS) to identify the right model(s) a decision-maker need(s) for fulfilling a specific purpose, in our case, production scheduling.

The standardized description of production scheduling models we built applies to every manufacturing domain. However, we focus on production scheduling models, especially from the injection molding domain, by performing literature research. 

In this repository, we provide:
a) The original manuscript,
b) The dictionary in the form of a PDF file that contains the standardized description of production scheduling models,
c) The dictionary in the form of an Excel file for a compact overview,
d) Single JSON files for each term that computers can use
