    "definition": "A flexible flow shop is a generalization of the flow shop and the parallel machine environments. Instead of m machines in series there are c stages in series with at each stage a number of identical machines in parallel. Each job has to be processed first at stage 1, then at stage 2, and so on. A stage functions as a bank of parallel machines; at each stage, job j requires processing on only one machine and any machine can do. The queues between the various stages may or may not operate according to the First Come First Served (FCFS) discipline.",
