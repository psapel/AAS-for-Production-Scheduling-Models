    "definition": "There are m machines in series. Each job has to be processed on each one of the m machines. All jobs have to follow the same route, i.e., they have to be processed first on machine 1, then on machine 2, and so on. After completion on one machine a job joins the queue at the next machine. Usually, all queues are assumed to operate under the First In First Out (FIFO) discipline, that is, a job cannot \u201cpass\u201d another while waiting in a queue.",
